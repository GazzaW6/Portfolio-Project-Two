# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a site that I produced to illustrate the functionality of javascript in a real world context through the development of a game of chance that creates random results. Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a fully responsive game that allows users to select either  Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard or Spock and play against the computer.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
