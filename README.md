# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a site that I produced to illustrate the functionality of javascript in a real world context through the development of a game of chance that creates random results. Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock is a fully responsive game that allows users to select either  Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard or Spock and play against the computer.

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement

- I would like to include a method of keeping score.

      - The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 42 while the median is 3.5.

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
